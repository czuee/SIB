# SIB

Worked performed during Internship at Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics.

Project1: To find differences in gene expression between males and females from HNSC data of The Cancer Genome Atlas.

Project2: Using machine learning algorithms to predict tumor types.

I'm using R programming for exploratory data analysis and statistics. I hope to learn get back to programming with this internship, and learn statistics and machine learning.
