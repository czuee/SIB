\maketitle

The gene expression data for HNSC was taken from the Cancer genome atlas study \cite{nature}. The data contained 566 samples for RNA-seq from males and females. In some cases, normal samples from the same individual were also present. The data was treated suitably for analysis. In part 1, the normal tissues were removed and only tumor samples were considered. In part 2, the samples for which both tumor and normal tissue are present were considered. The log of gene expression(+1) was considered for all cases, and the expression was centered around the mean in some cases.

\subsection{Selecting genes with highest variability}

The genes were filtered to select only genes that would have the highest variance in their gene expression and are more likely to have differential expression between males and females. The genes were sorted by the standard deviation (SD) of gene expression from all samples. The figure~\ref{sd-plot} shows the plot with ordered
